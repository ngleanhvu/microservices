Circuit breaker pattern is a pattern help prevent recall many times from failure service
in order to system is stable and avoid failure

There are 3 state

- Closed: accept client requests
- Open: when reach a threshold request failing -> switch open state which make request fail fast
- Half-open: Periodically Circuit breaker check if the issue is solved by allowing few request,
based on the result it will decide go to OPEN or CLOSED

CLOSED -(failure rate above the threshold) -> OPEN -(after wait duration) -> HALF-OPEN

In HALF-OPEN:
if failure rate above the threshold -> switch OPEN
either switch CLOSED
